## Privacy Policy – WAP – WhatsApp Privacy Toggler

**Effective date:** September 11, 2025

### Who we are
WAP – WhatsApp Privacy Toggler is a Chrome extension that automates a user-selected privacy toggle in WhatsApp Web. This tool is not affiliated with WhatsApp or Meta.

### What data we collect
We do not collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal data. The extension does not send data to any server and does not use analytics.

### Local processing only
All actions occur locally in your browser on `web.whatsapp.com`. The extension reads and interacts with page elements solely to open a contact profile and toggle the Advanced chat privacy setting as instructed by you.

### Data stored on your device
We store only non-personal settings in Chrome’s local storage:

- `wap_offset` (resume position)
- `wap_speed` (execution speed)
- `wap_mode` (enable/disable)

These remain on your device and can be cleared by removing the extension or clearing site/extension data.

### No access beyond WhatsApp Web
The extension requires the following permissions:

- **Tabs**: Identify the active WhatsApp Web tab and open links you request.
- **Scripting**: Inject the content script into WhatsApp Web when you click Start.
- **Storage**: Save the settings listed above.
- **Host permissions**: Limited to `https://web.whatsapp.com/*`.

The extension does not read or store your messages or contact content.

### Third-party links
If you click the “Download Signal” button, your browser will open [signal.org](https://signal.org/download/). Visiting third-party sites is optional and governed by their policies.

### Children’s privacy
This extension is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

### Security
We minimize data handling (settings only, stored locally). No transmission to external servers takes place.

### Changes to this policy
We may update this policy as needed. Material changes will be reflected by updating the Effective date above.

### Contact
For privacy questions or requests, contact: [ale.vir.mail@gmail.com](mailto:ale.vir.mail@gmail.com)

### Compliance note
As we do not collect, transmit, or share personal data, this extension complies with Chrome Web Store’s User Data policy and Limited Use requirements. If future versions add data collection, this policy and the extension disclosure will be updated accordingly.
